### ðŸ‘‹ Introduction 

Hello World! 

I got the chance to join the 6 month long AI training program run jointly by AIFFEL and Socar. 

`AIFFEL ê°•ë‚¨ X SOCAR Information` : [https://www.notion.so/AIFFEL-X-SOCAR-d212872ac7494b2c9b0225464f317ebd](https://www.notion.so/AIFFEL-X-SOCAR-d212872ac7494b2c9b0225464f317ebd)

AIFFEL is an AI training and research institution with the emphasis in creating a learning environment and platform for people to share their knowledge with others to grow as a team. 

I am very excited for this opportunity to be studying along side other talented IT developers.
