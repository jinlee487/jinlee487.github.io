Finished taking the Programmers 2021 Summer Coding Test. 

There were 3 algorithm questions and 1 MySQL question in 2 hours. 

The 2 hour limit was tough. 

The first two questions were easy but the third question was just as hard as the second problem for the KakaoTalk coding exam I took just the night before. 

The first and second problem was a sort problem.

For the first problem, I used an ArrayList and customized sort.

For the second problem, I used two PriorityQueues and also customized sort for each.

The third question was a dfs problem, which I could have solved if I had just 30 more minutes. 

The MySQL problem was a tough question, regarding join clause.

Overall, I think solving two questions was a success and I will be preparing for the next upcoming coding exam.
