Finished taking the 우아한 형제 coding test this morning and the KakaoTalk Internship coding test in the afternoon.

The 우아한 형제 coding test consisted of a sorting problem, an array problem and two others I cannot remember.

Even though I did not prepare practicing solving coding problems with JavaScript, I managed to solve 3 out of the 4 problems. 

So I am very happy about how I did and I hope for good results.

However, I did not do as well in the KakaoTalk Internship coding test. 

The first problem was a freebee. 

The second problem was a dfs problem which I managed to solve. 

The third problem was a greedy problem which I had to use a Linked List. 

Fourth problem was a dp problem, and I do not remember the last problem. 

I only managed to solve 2 out of the 5.

Still, I am proud of my progress, and I am certain that I will do better on the next coding test.
