Received this email couple days ago. 

This is my first, first round of coding exam for a major company I managed to pass since I started studying for coding tests. 

I am massively excited and now am busily preparing for the second round exam.

The second round of the coding tests usually consists of real world scenario-based developing coding problems.

I am preparing for the test which is on Saturday by solving the practice problems in programmers.

Even though I worked with front end development at my work, I am not used to this format of tests and in need to get prepared soon. I found a tech blog which explains the solution.

Looks like this will be a busy Friday night for me!
