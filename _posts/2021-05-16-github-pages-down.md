I was updating my Git Pages today but ran into a build failure error.

While I was trying to investigate for hours, I read a stackoverflow reply that it could be a problem caused by a GitHub server outage, and not a problem in my code. 

Here is the link to check for Github server status for anyone who might need it so they do not waste time like I did today!
