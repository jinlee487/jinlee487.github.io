Hello World!

This is my blog where I talk about my journey to becoming a savy IT developer. 
I will post about porfolios, projects, resume, algorithm, aws and other studies.
Please comment or message me with any questions, I am happy to talk :) 

I created this blog using the Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme. 
Here are the resources I referenced for help.
