I was working on recording videos and needed audio clips from Youtube.
I could use Youtube to mp3 conversion service sites... but I am a programmer. 
So I went ahead and created a simple script to download Youtube audios straight from Youtube.
This Python script uses Tkinter for the GUI design, pytube to download youtube streams and moviepy for mp3 converter.

Please message me with any feedback, I am happy talk :)
