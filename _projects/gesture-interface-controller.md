The Philly CodeFest 2022 is one of the biggest hackathons in Philadelphia hosted by Comcast and many other companies. 

My team won the Philly Codefest – Best Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DEI) Hack Winner
prize. The prize included a $1000 and a lunch & tour of the Comcast office. You can browse the project in the git repository and readMe for more information about the project!

As a challenge project for Philly CodeFest 2022, We decided to make a Virtual Reality Controller.

Inspiration
Emerging complex new technologies and new functions increase memory loads of remembering the interactions or button locations on website. Gesture interface design based on real world experience can make the learning process easier.

What it does
We designed a set of gesture interactions based on people’s experience from the real world. We expect the gesture interface we designed can reduce the memory loads and increase the user experience in people’s web browsing activities.

Please message me with any feedback, I am happy talk :)
