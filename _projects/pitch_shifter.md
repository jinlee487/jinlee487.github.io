I was working on recording videos and needed audio clips from Youtube.
I wanted to make vocal covers of my favorite songs by BTS, but the key of the song was too high. 
I created a python script to lower the pitch of the mp3 file. 
Now I can make covers of songs in a lower key! 

Please message me with any feedback, I am happy talk :)
