The Philly CodeFest 2023 is one of the biggest hackathons in Philadelphia hosted by Comcast and many other companies. 

My team won the Philly Codefest â€“ Applied AI 2 prize. The prize is a lunch & tour of the Comcast office. You can browse the project in the git repository and readMe for more information about the project!

Troubleshooting a broken internet connection can be stressful. Following written instructions can be especially challenging for those who don't speak/read the language and/or those who aren't familiar with technical terms (e.g., what is the coax cable? what does the modem look like?). **AI technology** can enable customers to simply interact with **Augmented Reality (AR)** and make the entire troubleshooting process easier to follow and more pleasant.

We built an AR application in which customers can troubleshoot Internet problems by simply clicking what they see on their cameras. Among various troubleshooting scenarios, for Philly CodeFest 2023, we decided to focus on one general problem that many Internet users may have faced: self-install the modem. 
Please message me with any feedback, I am happy talk :)
