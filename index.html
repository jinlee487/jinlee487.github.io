    title: "About me"
    excerpt: 'My name is Jay. I graduated UW-Madison with a BS in Economics, and only afterwards did I discover my passion for computer science. 
    After finishing a Java Web Development Boot Camp, I worked as a Full-Stack Developer for about 8 months. 
    However, I soon discovered my real passion lies in AI and Data Science. 
    I believe that it is never too late to find what I am passionate about. 
    As long as I give my **100%**, I will never have any regrets. I am a strong believer in long term goals. 
    Even if things might not work out as I planned, I know that it will add to my experience and I will always be a step closer to my goals. 
    Life is too short to half-ass'

    title: "Why did I choose to become a Developer"
    excerpt: 'I had trouble figuring out what I really wanted to do, until I took a Data Programming Python intro course in my senior year at UW-Madison. 
    I absolutely enjoyed the class. However, It was too late for me to change my major. 
    After graduation, thanks to Professor Tyler Harter, I was able to audit a Data Science python course for no credit after my work hours working as a staff accountant.
    Slowly but surely, my passion for programming grew bigger. What I like about programming is that it is like a puzzle waiting to be solved. 
    In highschool, I was in the chess varisity team and participated in non schoolastic chess tournaments. Programming is like reading the chess board for me. 
    It tweaks my interests more than anything else I ever studied back in school.'
